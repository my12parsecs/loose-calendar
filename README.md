# Loose Calendar
### A Calendar where each day has a little memo

If you don't like how every other calendar forces you to add "events" and enter the time, this is for you. You can loosely jot down what you need to do each day.


## Features

There are timestamps for better visibility. For example, @7-9 is converted to @7:00~9:00 (with styling) on the editor. [More about time stamps](https://loosecal.com/editor).


If you're on desktop, [Hotkeys](https://loosecal.com/hotkeys) are useful.
